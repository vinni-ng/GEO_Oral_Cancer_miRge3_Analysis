# GEO_Oral_Cancer_miRge3_Analysis
Analysis of miRNA expression between WT and FXR1 knockdown oral cancer cells.

GEO 
Gene Expression Omnibus is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted.

ENA
The European Nucleotide Archive provides a comprehensive record of the worldâ€™s nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information, and functional annotation.

mirGe3 
An update to the Python package to perform a comprehensive analysis of small RNA sequencing data, including miRNA annotation, A-to-I editing, novel miRNA detection, isomiR analysis, visualization through IGV, processing Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI), tRF detection and producing interactive graphical output.

Data mining 
Searched for the data available in the geo database that can be processed with the system currently available to me. The study was on examination of miRNA expression between WT and FXR1 knockdown oral cancer cells with geo accession GSE117031. Collected the SRA id from there and searched using the ENA browser. There were four fastq files there, downloaded the script. The link to download the fastq files directly is given below.
