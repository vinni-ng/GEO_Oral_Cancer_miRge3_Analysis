# GEO_Oral_Cancer_miRge3_Analysis
Analysis of miRNA expression between WT and FXR1 knockdown oral cancer cells.

# GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted.
# The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) provides a comprehensive record of the world’s nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information, and functional annotation.
# Data mining - Searched for the data available in the geo database that can be processed with the system currently available to me. The study was on examination of miRNA expression between WT and FXR1 knockdown oral cancer cells with geo accession GSE117031. Collected the SRA id from there and searched using the ENA browser. There were four fastq files there, downloaded the script.
